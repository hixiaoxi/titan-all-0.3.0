# Shut down all running instances of Titan. If the storage backend is Cassandra or HBase, do not shut down the respective storage backend but leave it running. So, only terminate the Titan processes.
# Create a backup of the storage backend. For BerkeleyDB, simply archive the contents of the storage directory. For "Cassandra":http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.0/operations/backup_restore and "HBase":http://hbase.apache.org/book/ops.backup.html, follow the directions for the respective backup functionalities. Store the backup in a secure place.
# Download and unzip Titan 0.2.0 on the (or one of the) machines that has been running Titan previously.
# Execute the upgrade010to020.sh/bat script in the bin directory of Titan 0.2.0 with the file name of the Titan configuration file (i.e. the argument passed into @TitanFactory.open()@) as the only argument. Follow the instructions. If asked to confirm the id block size, please ensure that the displayed value matches your configuration. If you did not configure this value, simply enter yes. Ensure that the script completes successfully.
# Install Titan 0.2.0 on all machines. Start Titan 0.2.0. Only use the 0.2.0 version of Titan from this point on.
